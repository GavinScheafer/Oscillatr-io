Music Clicker - A synthesized audio Cookie Clicker!

Unlike the original Cookie Clicker, you control this program by simply pressing the
"Play" button and watch as each note adds to an overall counter!

Current status:
In its current state, pressing "Play" will start a track that plays a note every
second, adding to your overall score each time. You can click the other buttons to
"spend" some of those points, which in the future will add notes to the mix.
Pressing "Stop" will stop the rhythm track where it is.

KNOWN ISSUES:
Unable to press "Play" again after stopping the track
